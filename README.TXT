The project is written in Java and can be compile easily via the following command:
		javac <ADDRESS OF THE Main.java FILE>

and it can be ran via:
		java <ADDRESS OF Main FILE>

Just ensure that the connectivity.txt file is in the same directory that you are running the program. And also, exclude
the .class extension when you run the program.

One sample file is comming with the project. The format of the input file is as described in the project description.
The result of running the program with the sample input can be found in the result.txt file. The output of the execution
is a adjcency matrix denoting the MST tree.

We tested out program on dc01.utdallas.edu with the jdk installed on it. We are almost sure that 
our program will be compiled on any jdk above 6.
